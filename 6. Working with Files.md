# Linux Commands for Files
1. **The touch command:**<br>
    It us used to create an empty file and modify timestamps of various files and directories.<br>
    **Syntax:**
    ```console
    [me@linuxbox~]$ touch filename/Directoryname
    ```
    For Example:
    ```console
    [mw@linuxbox~]$ touch Templates Videos
    ```
    The above example modifies the timestamps of the *Templates* and *Videos* folders.

    ```console
    [me@linuxbox~]$ touch file_1 file_2 file_3
    ```
    The above example creates  three new empty files with the filenames *file_1*, *file_2* and *file_3*.<br>
    ***
2. **The mkdir command:**<br>
    It is used to create a new directory. <br>
    **Syntax:**
    ```console
    [me@linuxbox~]$ mkdir Directoryname
    ```
    For Example:
    ```console
    [me@linuxbox~]$ mkdir directory_1, directory_2
    ```
    The above example creates two new directories with the name *directory_1* and *directory_2*. Also note that this command **cannot** create a directory hierarchy(directory_1/directory_2).<br>
    ***
3. **The rmdir command:**<br>
    It is used to delete a directory. However, this command removes a directory **if and only if** the directory is **empty**.<br>
    **Syntax:**
    ```console
    [me@linuxbox~]$ rmdir Directoryname
    ```
    For Example:
    ```console
    [me@linuxbox~]$ rmdir directory_1 directory_2
    ```
    The above example removes(deletes) the directories *directory_1* and *directory_2* if both the directories are empty. However if only one of them is empty then only the empty directory is deleted and the non-empty directory remains as it is.<br>
    ***
4. **The rm command:**<br>
    It is used to delete files or directories. This command deletes directories regardless of whether the directory is empty.<br>

    **Syntax:(To Delete a File)**
    ```console
    [me@linuxbox~]$ rm filename
    ```
    For Example:
    ```console
    rm file_1 file_2 file_3
    ```
    The above command deletes all the three files with filenames *file_1*, *file_2* and *file_3*.<br>

    **Syntax:(To Delete a Directory)**
    ```console
    [me@linuxbox~]$ rm -R Directoryname
    ```
    For Example:
    ```console
    [me@linuxbox~]$ rm -r directory_1
    ```
    The above command deletes the directory with name *directory_1* and everything under(within) that directory. Note that the *r* option used with this command is **not** case sensitive.<br>

    ***Options for the rm command:***
    * ***rm -i:*** Stands for ***Interactive***. It basically confirms with the user whether to remove the specified files and(or) directories.<br>
    * ***rm -f:*** Removes file ***forcefully*** without any confirmation. Ignores non-existent files.<br>

    ***
5. **The cp command:**

    **Syntax:(To copy a File)**
    ```console
    [me@linuxbox~]$ cp Original_file new_file
    ```
    For Example:

    [me@linuxbox~]$ cp file_1 file_2
    ```
    The above command creates a new file named *file_2* and copies the contents of the file *file_1* into the newly created file.<br>

    **Syntax:(To copy a Directory)**
    ```console
    [me@linuxbox~]$ cp -R directoryname_1 directoryname_2
    ```
    For Example:
    ```console
    [me@linuxbox~]$ cp -R directory_1 directory_2
    ```
    The above command copies the directory *directory_1* along with all its contents into the directory *directory_2*.<br>

    ***Options for the cp command:***
    * ***cp -i:*** Stands for ***Interactive***. It basically confirms with the user whether to copy the specified files and(or) directories.<br>

    It is used to move files or directories from one location to another. This command can also be used to rename files and directories or hide files.<br>
    **Syntax:(To move Files)**
    ```console
    [me@linuxbox~]$ mv "filename" "Destination"
    ```
    For Example:
    ```console
    [me@linuxbox~]$ mv "file_1" "/home/aditi/Directory_1"
    ```
    OR
    ```console
    [me@linuxbox~]$ mv "directory_1" "home/aditi/directory_2"
    ```
    In the **first** example above, the *mv* command is used to move *file_1* to a new location *Directory_1*.<br>
    In the **second** example above, the *mv* command is used to move *directory_1* along with all its contents to *directory_2*.<br>
    **Syntax:(To Hide Files)**
    ```console
    [me@linuxbox~]$ mv old_filename .new_filename
    ```
    For Example:
    ```console
    [me@linuxbox~]$ mv file_1 .file_1
    ```
    The above command on successful execution will hide the file *file_1*.<br>
    **Syntax(To Rename Files):**
    ```console
    [me@linuxbox~]$ mv old_filename new_filename
    ```
    For Example:
    ```console
    [me@linuxbox~]$ mv file_1 file_#1
    ```
    The above command on successful execution will rename the file *file_1* to *file_#1*.<br>

7. **The file command:**<br>
    In Linux, the filename extensions do not define the type of files. To determine the file type the **file** command is used This command also gives a summary of the contents of the file.
    **Syntax:**
    ```console
    [me@linuxbox~]$ file filename
    ```
### Filenames and Spaces
  To include spaces:
  ```console
  [me@linuxbox~]$ mkdir "Directory name"
  ```
  OR
  ```console
  [me@linuxbox~]$ mkdir 'Directory name'
  ```
  OR
  ```console
  [me@linuxbox~]$ mkdir Directory\ name
