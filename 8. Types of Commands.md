The Linux commands can be divided into four categories:
* Executable Programs
* Shell Built-ins
* Shell Scripts
* Aliases
1. **The type and file commands:**<br>
    It is used to find the type of the command.<br>
    **Syntax:(Type Command)**
    ```console
    [me@linuxbox~]$ type command
    ```
    For Example:
    ```console
    [me@linuxbox~]$ type echo
    ```
    However, the problem with the *type* command is that it cannot differentiate between a *Shell Scripts* and an *Executable*. To overcome this, the *file* command is used.<br>
    **Syntax:(File Command)**
    ```console
    [me@linuxbox~]$ file Absolute path of the *Shell Scripts* and/or *Executable*
    ```
    For Example:
    ```console
    [me@linuxbox~]$ file /bin/cat
    ```
    ***
2. **The which command:**<br>
    It is used to display the location of an *Executable* command.<br>
    **Syntax:**
    ```console
    [me@linuxbox~]$ which command_name
    ```
    For Example:
    ```console
    [me@linuxbox~]$ which ls
    ```
3. **The help and man command:**<br>
    The help information for an executable can be found with the *man* command. Similarly, for *Shell Built-ins* the help command is used.
    **Syntax:**
    ```console
    [me@linuxbox~]$ man/help name of *Executable*/*Shell Built-in*
    ```
4. **The whatis command:**
    It gives a brief description about the *Executable* command. It does not work with a *Shell Built-in*.
    **Syntax:**
    ```console
    [me@linuxbox~]$ whatis command_name
    ```
