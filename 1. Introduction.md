# Introduction

### Shell:
  The **Shell** is a program that takes keyboard commands and passes them to the operating system to carry out. The most common shell program from the GNU project is ***bash***. The name ***bash*** is an acronym for the ***Bourne Again Shell***.<br>

### Terminal:
  * When using a graphical user interface, we need another program called a ***Terminal emulator*** to interact with the shell.  
  * A variety of terminal emulators are available for Linux, but they all do the same thing give access to the *shell*. For example, the ***KDE*** uses ***konsole*** and ***GNOME*** uses the ***GNOME Terminal***.  
  * Once the *terminal* is launched the shell prompt can be seen. It appears like:  
```console
username@machinename
```
followed by current working directory followed by a dollar(**$**) sign or a pound(**#**) sign. The pound sign indicates that superuser privileges are active.

  For Example:<br>
  ```console
  [me@linuxbox~]$
  ```
### Command History:
  If the up-arrow key is pressed the previously typed command reappears. This is called *command history*.<br>
### Ending a Terminal Session
  We can end a terminal session by either closing the terminal emulator window or entering the exit command.
  ```console
  [me@linuxbox~]$ exit
  ```
### Virtual terminal:
  * Even when there is no terminal session running, several terminal sessions continue to run behind the graphical desktop. These terminal sessions are called ***Virtual Terminals*** or ***Virtual Consoles***. These sessions can be accessed by pressing *CTRL+ALT+F1* through *CTRL+ALT+F6*.
  * When a session is accessed, it presents a login prompt into which the user enters his *username* and *password*. To switch from one *virtual terminal* to another, press *ALT+F1* through *ALT+F6*. To return to the graphical desktop press *ALT+F7*.<br>
##### Opening a Terminal:
  * **For Ubuntu**: The shortcut *CTRL+ALT+T* opens the terminal.
  * **For Fedora**: Go to *Activities* (Top left Corner)-> Search for *Terminal*.
  * **For Open Suse(KDE)**: There are 2 ways--> *Start/Main Menu* -> *Terminal*.  OR *Start/Main Menu* -> *Applications* -> *System* -> *Terminal*.
