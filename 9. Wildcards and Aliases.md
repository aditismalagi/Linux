### Alias
* An ***alias*** can be used to define user-defined commands. By default, an *alias* is active for only the current session.
* To keep an ** active indefinitely, the user must add it in the *.bashrc* file.  
 **Syntax:**
 ```console
        [me@linuxbox~]$alias new_command_name="Task(s) to be performed"
 ```
 For Example:
 ```console  
      [me@linuxbox~]$alias invent="cd Desktop; mkdir dir1; touch file1; date; cal"

      [me@linxbox~]$invent
```
* To remove(delete) an alias:
```console
      [me@linuxbox~]$unalias "new_command_name"
```
* To view all the active aliases on the system:
```console
      [me@linuxbox~]$alias
```
