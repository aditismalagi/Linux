# The Directory Tree
* The file system for Linux has a tree like structure also known as the ***Directory Tree***.<br>
* A location that stores multiple files and is used to organize information is known as a folder. In Linux terminology, folder is always referred to as a ***Directory***.<br>
* The *Directory Tree* is similar to a family tree. Thus each directory/folder has a parent and only single parent. The *root* directory, however, has no parents.<br>
* Some of directories in Linux are:<br>
  1. **bin**: Stands for ***Binary***. This directory contains executable programs and commands that can be used by all the users of the system.<br>
  2. **opt**: Stands for ***Optional***. This directory contains commercial software products that are not installed by default on the system.
  3. **tmp**: Stands for ***Temporary***. This directory contains temporary files i.e. files that are often changed or deleted.<br>
  4. **var**: Stands for ***Variable***. This directory contains variable data i.e. data that frequently changes over time. Ex: Log files, mail spools and user database.
* Linux is a multi-user environment. Each user is given a separate directory under the home directory.

## Absolute Path
  The absolute path begins with the root directory and follows the tree branch until the path to the desired directory or file is completed.<br>
  For Example:
  ```console
  [me@linuxbox~]$ /home/aditi/documents/runme.sh
  ```
  The above path is the absolute path for the file "runme.sh".

## Relative Path
  A relative path starts from the current working directory to desired file.
  For Example:
  ```console
  [me@linuxbox~]$ ./documents/runme.sh
  ```
#### Note:<br>
  ***.*** -> Represents the **Current Directory**.<br>
  ***..*** -> Represents the **Parent Directory**.<br>
  These two directories can be found in every directory of the system.
