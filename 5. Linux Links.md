# Linux Links
### INODE:<br>
* For every file in the filesystem there exists an **index node** also called an **INODE**.
* **INODE** is like a database of the file which contains lot of information regarding the file except its name(filename) and contents. Some of the information it contains:
  1. *INODE Number*
  2. *File Size*
  3. *Owner information*
  4. *Permissions*
  5. *File Type*
  6. *Number of links*  etc..

### Links
* There are two types of Linux Links:
  1. **Soft Links**
  2. **Hard Links**

1. **Soft Links:**
  * It is also known as ***symbolic links***.
  * It is pointer to the original file similar to a windows shortcut.
  * The inode number of the *soft link* is different from the inode number of the original file. The size of the *soft link* is very small compared to the size of the original file.
  * If the original file is deleted, the *soft link* becomes useless.<br>
  * To create a *soft link*:
```console
[me@linuxbox~]$ ln -s original_Filename softlink_name
```

2. **Hard Links:**
  * It is basically a different name of the same file.
  * It has the same inode number and the same file size as that of the original file.
  * The original file and the *hard link* cannot be differentiated
  * If the original file is deleted, the *hard link* will still contain the data that was in the original file.
  * To create a *hard link*:
```console
[me@linuxbox~]$ ln original_Filename hardlink_name
```

### Creating a Directory Loop
Consider 3 directories with the absolute pathnames as follows:<br>
  * Directory_1:- /home/aditi/Directory_1.
  * Directory_2:- /home/aditi/Directory_1/Directory_2.
  * Directory_3:- /home/aditi/Directory_1/Directory_2/Directory_3.<br>

then to create a directory loop there are 3 ways:
1.
```console
[me@linuxbox~]$ ln -s /home/aditi/Directory_1 Directory_3
```
2.
```console
[me@linuxbox~/Directory_1/Directory_2]$ ln -s .. Directory_3
```
3.
```console
[me@linuxbox~/Directory_1/Directory_2]$ ln -s /home/aditi/Directory_1 Directory_3
```
