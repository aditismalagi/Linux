1. **The history command:**<br>
    It shows all the commands that were executed previously.
    For Example:
    ```console
    [me@linuxbox~]$ history 10
    ```
    The above command will display a list of last 10 commands executed. To execute a particular command from the listed commands:
    ```console
    [me@linuxbox~]$ !"number corresponding to the command that needs to be executed."
    ```
    The file *.bash_history* stores the command line history. It is stored in the home directory. If this file is changed or edited the system should restart for it to reflect the changes. To clear the entire history:
    ```console
    [me@linuxbox~]$ history -c
    ```
    ***
2. **The less command:**<br>
    It is used for **viewing** text files and **NOT** editing them.<br>
    **Syntax:**
    ```console
    [me@linuxbox~]$ less filename
    ```
    For Example:
    ```console
    [me@linuxbox~]$ less file_1
    ```
    The above command opens the file *file_1* in a new window for viewing.<br>
    ***
3. **The cat command:**<br>
    It is similar to the less command but it displays the contents of the file on the terminal itself. The command concatenates the contents of all the files specified for viewing.<br>
    **Syntax:**
    ```console
    [me@linuxbox~]$ cat filename
    ```
    For Example:
    ```console
    [me@linuxbox~]$ cat file_1 file_2 file_3 file_4 file_5
    ```
    The above example displays the contents of all the five files *file_1*, *file_2*, *file_3*, *file_4* and *file_5* in the order they are mentioned.
    ***
4. **The tac command:**<br>
    It is exactly as the cat command with only one difference- It reverses the output.<br>
    For Example:
    ```console
    [me@linuxbox~]$ cat odd.txt
    ```
    The output of the above command will be as follows:
    ```
    1
    3
    5
    7
    9
    ```
    Now consider the following command:
    ```console
    [me@linuxbox~]$ tac odd
    ```
    The output of the above command will be as follows:
    ```
    9
    7
    5
    3
    1
    ```
    ***
5. **The head and tail commands:**<br>
    The head command is used to view the first 10 lines of the file. Similarly, the tail command is used to view the last 10 lines of the file. The number of lines viewed can be changed with *-n* option.<br>
    **Syntax:**
    ```console
    [me@linuxbox~]$ head/tail -n number of lines filename
    ```
    For Example:
    1.
    ```console
    [me@linuxbox~]$ head -n 20 file_1
    ```
    2.
    ```console
    [me@linuxbox~]$ tail -n 30 file_1
    ```
    ***
6. **The wc command:**<br>
    Stands for word count. It gives the word count of the file i.e. number of lines, number of words and number of characters followed by the filename.<br>
    **Syntax:**
    ```console
    [me@linuxbox~]$ wc filename
    ```
    For Example:
    ```console
    [me@linuxbox~]$ wc file_1
    ```
    ***Options for the wc command:***
    * ***-l:*** Displays only the number of lines in the file.
    * ***-w:*** Displays only the number of words in the file.
    * ***-c:*** Displays only the number of characters in the file.
    * ***-L:*** Displays the length (number of characters) of the longest line of the file.
