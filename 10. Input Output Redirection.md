### I/O Redirection: Pipes
* Pipes take the standard output from one command and use that as an input to another command.  
For Example:
```console
     [me@linuxbox~]$cat txt1 | cat
```
### I/O Redirection: Output to a file
* A redirection operator ***'>'*** allows the user to direct the output of one command from standard output(monitor) to a different file.
For Example:
```console
     [me@linuxbox~]$cat txt1 > foo
```
* The above command will rewrite the file *foo* every time it is executed. In order to append the data into a single file following variation of the command is used:
```console
     [me@linuxbox~]$grep Santosh txt1 >> foo
```
### I/O Redirection: Input from a file
* A redirection operator ***'<'*** allows the user to direct the data from a file as an input to a command or a script.
For Example:
```console
     [me@linuxbox~]$./conversation.py < name
```
### Tee
* It is a program that reads from standard input(keyboard) and writes to both standard output(monitor) and a file.
For Example:
```console
     [me@linuxbox~]$cat txt1 | tee foo
```
